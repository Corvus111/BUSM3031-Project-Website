                    My chosen leader to research is Gabe Newell, the CEO and Co-Founder of Valve Software. This website will go over who he is as a leader, some leadership traits,
                    and some beliefs that are presented through his actions. Some examples of the topics are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>His effect on the gaming industry as a whole.</li>
                    <li>Not fearing to take risks on new products.</li>
                    <li>A near open source belief for software.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Naviage to each section through the navigation bar above to learn more about Gabe Newell as a leader and how his actions have and are affecting industry.
                    I have also included a reflection of relating Newell's leadership trait's back to myself on what I could improve and believe to be important myself.
