                    The beliefs page will cover how Newell's leadership is affect by his personal beliefs, and how they relate to industry. The covered beliefs are seen below:

                <ul>
                    <li>Believes in software leaning towards open source instead of closed source.</li>
                    <li>Allowing the community to take a role into evolving a game after they are finsihed.</li>
                    <li>A flat hierarchy structure where no one is truly the "boss".</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Continue on below to see how these beliefs have shaped Newell's actions as a leader and how they have influenced the greater industry as well.

                    One of the most interesting beliefs I believe Newell has, and one that affects his leadership majorly, is his belief in open platforms. This can be seen with a comparison that Newell has stated in a Polygon interview, saying that many platforms in the modern day are “creating an iPhone-like walled garden, charging rent on an entire industry and controlling competitors' access to markets” (Campbell, 2017). By having this constricted environment for technology, it hides the inner workings of many platforms while also constricting developers and consumers to either follow the company’s software rules, or risk not having their application run at all. In contrast, Newell has shown belief that open platforms are  greater for both the consumer and developer, and has actively worked towards progressing markets towards accepting more open platformed operating systems for gaming. This can be seen with Valve’s choice to use Linux as the basis for the Steam Deck, where according to Newell, was to utilize the open platform nature of Linux to maintain the idea that “the openness of the PC is something we love” while still creating “a system in which a gamer who’s operating with Linux doesn’t even know they’re using Linux” (Archer, 2022). This action represents Newell’s belief in open platforms, as not only did his company decide to use the open platform of Linux in a major hardware release, but also worked towards making it more accommodating for newer users who may be turned away from the differences compared to Mac and Windows devices they likely would come from. As well as that, he seems to have wanted to keep it closer to being a PC by maintaining more freedom towards the user for the Steam Deck compared to that of other handheld consoles on the market which follow the more restrictive qualities mentioned previously. This all combines into a major leadership influence towards Newell, as his belief in open platforms has affected his company’s actions in not only trying to popularize open platforms, but actively improve them for the gaming industry themselves while still providing the consumer and developers with the freedoms that would come alongside open platforms on a usually closed platform market.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Approves of Community Developers</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    Continuing off of Newell’s belief in open platforms, he also seems to carry a belief that some extent of open source is beneficial for games, even if limited as a basis to new softwares to grow off of without complete access to the code. This belief can be seen very recently, as Valve officially released the software development kit for their game Team Fortress 2. According to the post, “this SDK gives mod makers the ability to change, extend or rewrite TF2” while still gaining the ability that “TF2 mods may be published on the Steam Store” assuming that they follow certain rules of making both the mod and content within the mod free (TF2 Team. 2025). This essentially says that Valve is willing to not only allow you to use the code of Team Fortress 2 as a basis for a massive modification, possibly leading to essentially a new game compared to the original, but also is willing to host it as an independent game on Steam as long as it stands within certain rules. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If desired, you can view the SDK <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/tree/master">here</a> on GitHub.</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    This type of release of code is almost unheard of in modern times, let alone the code of a major game that still pulls thousands of players daily. Even with Valve’s flat hierarchy, of which is discussed next, there is no way a major release like this would not have gotten the approval of the CEO, Gabe Newell. As a result, I believe this represents Newell’s belief that developers in the community should have the chance to continue on the game long past the time Valve may, but also acts as a continuation of Newell’s belief in open platforms. While not completely open, the code release includes “all the Team Fortress 2 client and server game code” with the exceptions of possibly code that is not used independently by Team Fortress 2 itself, but all of Valve games (TF2 Team. 2025). This is extremely open and allows both consumers and developers to have the freedom to essentially use the game as a sandbox for new creations similar to how Linux as an open platform allows you to modify the operating system itself.
