                    This page will act as a reflection which I cover how I believe I could link Newell's traits to myself as a leader currently and in the future:

                alt="Image of Gabe Newell"></a>

        <div class="col">

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Personal Reflection</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    I believe that Newell’s leadership traits are unique for a major tech company in the gaming industry and can act as a good basis of traits I believe I would want as a leader myself. These characteristics would be the ability to lead based on beliefs, knowledge of industry, and a high risk tolerance. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col" id="generaltext">
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    I believe that the biggest thing I would want to do as a leader is to lead based on beliefs like Newell does, and utilize my position to advance both the company and sectors which I believe to be important. This can be seen through Newell in his sense of open platforms as previously discussed. I think this is an important trait of a leader, as it gives motivation not only to yourself, but also to those who you lead, as if the leader is passionate about something, then those around them tend to get a sense of excitement as well. Not only that, but advancing something you believe in is something I believe to be important, as it gives a sense of accomplishment and meaning outside of being a good leader. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col" id="generaltext">
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    The next trait I feel like I could improve upon which Newell has is his knowledge of industry. Despite being a Computer Science major, I feel like I don’t really know what is happening in industry currently beyond what I hear offhand at school or see online. Compared to Newell who seems to know both the technology and those using it, I could improve majorly by branching out and actively looking for sources which could act as a reliable source of information about the tech industry in general, whether it is hardware or gaming. This would also benefit me as a leader, as I desire to go into a job in tech, and knowing emerging technologies would give me an advantage of being able to act quickly if something seems promising compared to not being one of the first into the market if I learn too late after others.
                </p>

            <div class="col" id="generaltext">
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    The final trait I believe I could improve upon would be risk tolerance. Unlike Newell who sees risk as something to almost strive for, as it can be beneficial in success and failure, I tend to be much more risk averse. While I know that failure can act as major stepping stones to greater success, the fear of failure and stress of failing does influence my actions almost instinctively. As a result, I believe that this is one of the grounds I stand to improve upon the most, and can use Newell’s leadership experience as a reference to how it can be beneficial, as only through failing can you learn important lessons on how to make your next product even better.
