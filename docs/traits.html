                    The traits page will cover some of Newell's traits as a leader. The three traits covered are below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risks are not to be feared, but learned from.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of emerging technology in his industry.</li>
                    <li>Unique media presence and communication.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Continue on below to learn how these traits have been presented through Gabe Newell's actions and interviews as a leader.

            <!-- Risk Tolerance -->
            <div class="col" id="generaltext">
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Risk Tolerance</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    One of the biggest traits which stand out about Newell is his risk tolerance, believing risk is fine as a chance to learn from past mistakes and shows that you are willing to provide something truly interesting for consumers. His stance is very easily summed up from a Polygon where he states “We’re pretty comfortable with the idea that it will turn out to be a complete failure” (Campbell, 2017). This belief is seen in effect though as Valve has developed different physical software over the years, namely console related products. In an interview with Rock Paper Shotgun, the question regarding how past failures affected thedevelopment of the Steam Deck, of which Newell responded saying that they learned that “you can’t give people a framework deliveringfor delivering value to customers and expect them to make a set of choices that are consistent with the ones you would have made” (Archer, 2022). These statements show Newell’s perspective on failure, and how he has used it to lead Valve as a company which does notfear failure, but instead uses it as a chance for improvement. Even if a product had failed or suffered due to mistakes in the past, the lessons learned can be used to improve future products as seen with the Steam Deck.

            <!-- Knowledge Of Industry -->
            <div class="col" id="generaltext">
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Knowledgeable of Industry</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    Another trait of Newell is his knowledge of trends and emerging technologies in his industry, and can make decisive decisions based on that knowledge. This can be seen when Steam banned NFTs and cryptocurrency inside games. When Newell was asked about whether the technology belongs inside games, Newell responded stating that “you have to separate the underlying technology versus which actors are utilizing that technology” (Archer, 2022). This can be interpreted as the blockchain itself as a technology that works great and could be implemented well, but those who utilize it as the dominant influencers are more of the issues. Valve also has allowed cryptocurrency to act as a mode of payment on Steam back in 2016, but quickly removed it due to “the issue of volatility” and “the vast majority of those transactions, for whatever reason, were fraudulent” (Archer 2022). The evidence of previous attempts also shows that Newell is knowledgeable about the technology, as this was before the major crypto explosion around 2020, but also ended due to similar reasoning. While Newell knows that technology can work well, he also knows that it will likely be misused, whether it is a result of past experiences or the amount of news you hear regarding the technology in modern times.

            <!-- Media Presence -->
            <div class="col" id="generaltext">
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Media Presence</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                    One of the traits I find most interesting about Newell is how he tends to present himself to the media, or moreso the lack of his presence. This is seen through an interview done by Polygon, where when asked whether he disliked talking to the press, Newell responded that he “kind of gets bored listening to myself talk. So I assume other people are bored listening to me talk” (Campbell, 2017). This response could be the reason behind his elusive nature of which I discovered trying to do research on Newell, as despite being an influential person, there is little information about him outside of the periodical interview. I also discovered that this is true for social media as well. During my search, I could not find a single official account run by Newell, as the only accounts that exist are either parody or fan accounts. As a leader though, this trait does not seem to diminish his communication skills, but instead give the sense that every interview held is just as important due to the guarantee for new information to be given out from my experience reading through them.
